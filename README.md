# lesson1_2
I am studying Tailwind. This is the initial setup by Dave Grey instruction Video. So I saved it for awhile as the "TheGreenDot so I can pull it up fresh after I mess something up. ðŸ§¹  
 Go to the File "TheGreenDot" change file name to lesson 1-2 to bring it back to here.
 Change the other Lesson 1-2 to something else first.
Right now TheGreenDot is my standard tailwind setup. heres some set up info 



npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./build/css/style.css --watch





It's hard to say without seeing the specific error messages you are receiving. However, it's possible that the errors are related to the configuration of your Tailwind setup or the specific files you are working with.

Here are some general steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

Check the error messages carefully and try to identify any patterns or commonalities between them. This may give you a clue as to what is causing the errors.

Check your Tailwind configuration file (usually tailwind.config.js) to make sure it is set up correctly. You can refer to the Tailwind documentation for guidance on how to configure your setup.

Make sure that the files you are working with are correctly formatted and free of syntax errors. You can use a linter or syntax checker to help identify any issues.

Try running the npx tailwindcss command without the --watch flag to see if the errors persist.
