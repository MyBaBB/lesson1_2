# lesson1_2
I am studying Tailwind. This is the initial setup by Dave Grey instruction Video. So I saved it for awhile as the "TheGreenDot so I can pull it up fresh after I mess something up. ðŸ§¹  
 Go to the File "TheGreenDot" change file name to lesson 1-2 to bring it back to here.
 Change the other Lesson 1-2 to something else first.
Right now TheGreenDot is my standard tailwind setup. heres some set up info
